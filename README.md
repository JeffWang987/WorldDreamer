# Abstract 

World models play a crucial role in understanding and predicting the dynamics of the world, which is essential for video generation.
However, existing world models are confined to specific scenarios such as gaming or driving, limiting their ability to capture the complexity
of general world dynamic environments. Therefore, we introduce WorldDreamer, a pioneering world model to foster a comprehensive comprehension 
of general world physics and motions, which significantly enhances the capabilities of video generation. Drawing inspiration from the success 
of large language models, WorldDreamer frames world modeling as an unsupervised visual sequence modeling challenge. This is achieved by mapping 
visual inputs to discrete tokens and predicting the masked ones. During this process, we incorporate multi-modal prompts to facilitate
interaction within the world model. Our experiments show that WorldDreamer excels in generating videos across different scenarios, including 
natural scenes and driving environments. WorldDreamer showcases versatility in executing tasks such as text-to-video conversion, imageto-video 
synthesis, and video editing. These results underscore WorldDreamerâ€™s effectiveness in capturing dynamic elements within diverse general world environments.
